# Sidebars for WordPress Editor

While Future Shop products are a built-in WordPress feature, the ability to sell products relies on connecting a Future Shop to a Stripe product. This connection is managed through the Stripe sidebar provided by Future Shop core.

### Other

Currently the only sidebar provide by Future Shop Core is for Stipe, but there may be other Sidebars created in the future and those will be documented in this area.

NOTE: Sidebars must be simplistic and only include necessary informaiton for that specific sidebar. If an add-on is created to tie products to digital downloads, for example, then a separate sidebar would need to be created for Downloads.
