# Future Shop and the WordPress Editor

Out of the box, Future Shop products utilize the WordPress Editor (Gutenberg) to build media rich product pages.

## Blocks

Future Shop will need custom blocks for managing the cart contents and those will be documented in this section.

## Sidebars

Products are tied to products in Stripe using the custom Stripe sidebar created for Future Shop (see [sidebars/README.md](sidebars/README.md) for more information).

## Patterns

Patterns are ways for users to create common layouts in the WordPress Editor, and we will utilize patterns to create some useful product layouts.

## Styles

Styles are any block style alterations to add, of which we currently know of one for adding icons to the button componenet.
